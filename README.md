# Vijay Krishna — Portfolio

Source for the portfolio site deployed at: https://vjaykrsna.github.io

This repository is kept intentionally minimal. It's a static portfolio deployed to GitHub Pages and not intended to be run locally by visitors.

Resources (if you want to learn web development or build a similar portfolio):

- [Apna College — HTML/CSS/JS (YouTube playlist)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe0PY9xunOzsP5kmYIz2Hu7i&si=zY_Y0brnkqmyFnOm)
- [Scrimba — Learn React (Bob Ziroll)](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e)

Notes:

- Bob Ziroll's hands-on approach helped me a lot; following along with small projects makes the fundamentals stick.
- Scrimba's interactive editor is useful for immediate, practical practice when learning React.
